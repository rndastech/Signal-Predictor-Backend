# AnalysisDetail.js Visualization and CSV Download Updates

## Overview
Updated the AnalysisDetail.js component to include proper visualization display for saved analysis plots and CSV download functionality, matching the design patterns from Results.js.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added CSV Download Functionality
- **New Handler Function**: Added `handleDownloadCSV()` function to enable CSV file downloads
  - Uses the `analysis.uploaded_file` URL from the backend
  - Creates a temporary download link and triggers the download
  - Automatically extracts filename from the URL or uses a default name

### 2. Enhanced Data Preview Section
- **Header Layout**: Updated to match Results.js design with:
  - Flex layout for title and download button
  - Added "First 10 rows" badge in the header
  - Repositioned CSV download button next to the title
- **Download Button**: Styled to match other action buttons with:
  - Green color scheme (#28a745)
  - Hover effects with transform and glow
  - Font Awesome download icon
- **Table Styling**: Updated to match Results.js exactly:
  - Dark theme with proper Bootstrap classes
  - Consistent header styling with teal accents
  - Improved cell padding and typography
  - Monospace font for data values
  - Precise number formatting (3 decimal places)

### 3. Updated Visualization Section
- **Plot Titles**: Changed titles to match Results.js naming:
  - "Frequency Analysis" → "Frequency Spectrum"
  - "Original Signal Analysis" → "Original vs Reconstructed Signal"
  - "Fitted Signal Analysis" → "Training vs Testing Performance"
- **Layout**: Maintained the responsive grid layout (2 plots in top row, 1 full-width below)
- **Styling**: Consistent with Results.js visualization cards

### 4. Conditional Rendering
- **Visualizations**: Display only when plots are available in the saved analysis
- **Data Preview**: Display only when `data_preview` data exists
- **CSV Download**: Show download button only when `uploaded_file` is available

## Technical Details

### Field Mapping
The component correctly uses the Django model field names:
- `analysis.frequency_analysis_plot` - Frequency spectrum plot
- `analysis.original_signal_plot` - Original vs reconstructed signal plot  
- `analysis.fitted_signal_plot` - Training vs testing performance plot
- `analysis.uploaded_file` - Original CSV file for download
- `analysis.data_preview` - First 10 rows of data for preview table

### Styling Consistency
- Maintains the futuristic dark theme from the rest of the application
- Uses consistent hover effects and transitions
- Matches color schemes and spacing from Results.js
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views

### User Experience
- Clear visual indication of available features (plots, data, download)
- Intuitive download functionality with proper file naming
- Consistent interaction patterns across the application
- Accessible button styling with proper focus states

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/AnalysisDetail.js` - Main component updates

## Backend Dependencies
The component relies on the backend providing:
- Plot image URLs in the analysis object
- Uploaded file URL for CSV download
- Data preview array with x/y coordinate objects
- Proper CORS and media serving configuration

This implementation ensures that saved analyses display all their associated visualizations and data while providing users with the ability to download their original CSV files, matching the design and functionality expectations set by the Results.js component.
