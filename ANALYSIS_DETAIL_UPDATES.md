I've successfully updated the AnalysisDetail.js component to match the design of Results.js with the following key additions:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Download CSV Button**
- Added a "DOWNLOAD CSV" button next to the rename button
- Only shows when `analysis.uploaded_file` exists
- Uses the same styling as other buttons with green color scheme
- Properly handles download functionality

### 2. **Visualizations Section**
- Added a complete visualizations card that displays saved plot images
- Shows frequency analysis, original signal, and fitted signal plots
- Uses the same grid layout as Results.js (6-6-12 column layout)
- Only displays when visualizations are available (`has_visualizations` or individual plot fields)
- Images are loaded from the saved URLs in the model

### 3. **Data Preview Section**
- Added a data preview table showing the first 10 rows of uploaded data
- Styled table with hover effects and proper formatting
- Shows X (Time) and Y (Signal) columns with 4 decimal precision
- Only displays when `data_preview` data exists

### 4. **Design Consistency**
- All new sections use the same card styling as existing components
- Consistent hover effects with transform and glow animations
- Same color scheme and spacing as Results.js
- Proper responsive design with Bootstrap grid system

## Key Features:

1. **Saved Analysis Display**: Shows all saved visualizations and data without recomputation
2. **CSV Download**: Direct download of the original uploaded file
3. **Visual Consistency**: Matches the futuristic design of Results.js exactly
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Only shows sections when data is available
5. **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes

The component now provides a complete view of saved analyses with all the visual elements users expect, including the ability to download their original data and view all saved plots.

## File Structure:
- Header with action buttons (Rename, Download CSV, Delete, Share)
- Fitted Function display
- Model Parameters and Dominant Frequencies (side by side)
- Function Evaluation tool
- **NEW**: Visualizations section with saved plots
- **NEW**: Data Preview table
- Navigation links
- Modal dialogs for rename/delete operations

This creates a unified experience where saved analyses show the same rich information as fresh analysis results.
